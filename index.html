                    After receiving my associates degree from DeVry Univeristy in Network Systems Administration, I immidiately started my career in the tech industry. I started as a tier 1 Technical Support Agent and quickly rose above the ranks.
                    I established myself as a subject matter expert on Morgan Stanley's web applications and soon after transitioned my career into the quality assurance management realm, becoming a Quality Professional.
                    After several years of working at Morgan Stanley I wanted to change my focus to become more technical savvy and soon thereafter, I moved to Charlotte and started working in the data field.

                    Once again, I found myself working from an entry level postion but soon established myself again as subject matter expert. I worked closely with AGDATA's largest client and became essential in providing client support during the merger of Bayer and Monsanto. 
                    Soon thereafter, I became a customer support analyst, working directly with data and the development teams to deliver client directives. Unfortunately, covid hit and I was one of many Americans who lost their job.
                    I didn't let this hinder my growth, however, as I took the time to work on my health and mental aptitude by enrolling in the UNCC Coding Bootcamp.
